# Overview
I collaborated on a research project under Dr. Sumohana S. Channappayya, Professor in Electrical Engineering at IIT Hyderabad, to develop a novel label transfer algorithm. The goal involved manually labeling frames at periodic intervals and predicting intermediate frames(Semi-automatic labelling) using the developed label transfer algorithm to generate a labeled aerial image dataset.

In this project, I assessed the effectiveness of the proposed label transfer algorithm for label transfer in aerial videos by comparing its performance, specifically the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and mean accuracy (mAccuracy) values, with existing techniques such as SIFT Flow and DSP.

We submitted a paper titled 'Semi-Automatic Labelling of Aerial Videos via Label Transfer' to ICIP 2020. Unfortunately, the paper was not accepted for presentation at the conference.
